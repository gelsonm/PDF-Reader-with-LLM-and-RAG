# Project Overview

## PDF Processing and Embedding

- Developed a PDF processing and embedding feature for efficient text extraction from PDFs using Python.
- Utilized LangChain for document segmentation to enhance the organization of extracted text.
- Integrated SentenceTransformer for embedding generation and employed Chroma for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.

## Configuration Management

- Established a robust configuration management system by defining constants in constants.py.
- Managed Chroma settings through constants, ensuring a modular and easily configurable system for the entire application.

## Streamlit QA Application

- Designed and implemented a user-friendly Streamlit application (app.py) for real-time question answering based on PDF content.
- Leveraged Transformers and LangChain to enable dynamic and interactive question-and-answer features.
- Incorporated advanced language models, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to enhance the quality of responses and user experience.
